            "Asteroids! Aren't those what killed the dinosaurs?",
            "Asteroids are some of the most fascinating bodies in the universe. While many of us were taught about the eight planets of our Solar System - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - schools rarely dive deep into asteroids unless you later choose to specialise in Astronomy.",
            "Have you ever heard of 1979 XB or 433 Eros? Probably not, but that is exactly why we are here!",
            "At Asteroid collection, we are dedicated to educating the public about the asteroids in our universe. Asteroids are rocky, metallic or icy bodies that vary in size and typically orbit the Sun. However, there are unique cases where an asteroid may begin to orbit other celestial bodies.",
            "Most known asteroids form the Main Asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. There is also the Kuiper belt which falls beyond Neptune's orbit and is located 50 AU (astronomical units) from the sun.",
            "We offer the public a vast catalogue of over 7000 asteroids to discover! Here you may see precise details of each asteroid such as its estimated diameter, inclination, semi-major axis and orbit class type. We also leverage Generative Artificial Intelligence to produce detailed, downloadable PDF reports on any asteroid of your liking.",
            "Discover the rock-solid truth about asteroids. Stay grounded and keep looking up!"
